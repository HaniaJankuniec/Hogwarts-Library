    - We will use meaningful commit messages 
    - We will use appropriate branches to synchronise workflow 
    - Adding files to branches 
3. Create a gitignore file 
4. Create a reqiurements.txt file and briefly explain what it's for 

**How to work as a team on github**

1. Set up a branch using git checkout -b <branch-name>

2. Complete your changes and then use git add . or git add -A 
[this is the difference between what your files should look like before git adding](/workflowImages/git%20before%20add.png)
[Git after add](/workflowImages/git%20after%20add.png)

3. Now commit your changes, if its the first time you may have to set the upstream origin to your local repo name 
[using git commit -m](/workflowImages/git%20add%20git%20commit.png)
