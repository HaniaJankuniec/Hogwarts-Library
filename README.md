## **How to work as a team on github**

### 1. Set up a branch using **git checkout -b < branch-name >** (without the spaces next to the branch name)

### 2. Complete your changes and then use **git add . or git add -A**

![this is the difference between what your files should look like before git adding](/workflowImages/git%20before%20add.png)

### 3. Now **commit your changes**, if its the first time you may have to set the upstream origin to your local repo name
